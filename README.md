# W3X-RA3-shaders-for-max2023
Rewrite RedAlert3 shaders so you can assign, preview and export materials just like those back in 3dsMax9
How to use:
Download any of these FX files as you need (don't compile them) put them in any folder you like,
and choose the shader you need in 3dsmax compact material editor.
Basically the same workflow as those in 3dsmax 9
To export the model: 
you need to use the updated w3x exporter
https://w3dhub.com/forum/files/file/37-w3d-tools-3ds-max-2023-exporter/
it will record all your shader parameters into the w3x mesh files just fine 
(find "FXshader" in your W3X file to check on them if you like)
